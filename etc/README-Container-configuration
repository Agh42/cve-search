You have to supply a configuration.ini in this directory.

There are two ways: 
- copy a configuration.ini into the container (when running just with
  docker)
- provide a configmap from Kubernetes (when running under Kubernetes)

Commands i.e.:

1. docker cp configuration.ini <containerid>:/cve-search/etc/

2. kubectl apply -f deploy/k8s/configuration.yaml
